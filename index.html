    <h3>Real Men Don't Cry??</h3>
    <p>Is that so? I obviously beg to differ. I do believe that God literally gave us emotions,
        as human attributes, and we all express them differently.
        However, I do not believe that we are to be <em>led</em> by our emotions. Our feelings
        should be driven by that which is true, we should not be driven by our feelings.
        The book of Proverbs talks about this a <b>lot</b>. But this is not a dissertation on emotions.
        This is a brief overview of several films that have caused me to respond in an <em>emotional</em> way.
        Be prepared to laugh.

    <h3>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)</h3>
    <!-- imdb link https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=2ahUKEwiSh47crYTpAhWyVN8KHce4DH0QFjADegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0083866%2F&usg=AOvVaw2FEebNw-ZUcsfgiSV2GCsO -->
    <p>This sci-fi/family/coming of age movie is wonderful in it's own right, and has been solidified
        as one of the greatest films of all time. Not that this means much, but worldwide, E.T. has
        grossed nearly 80 times it's budget of $10.5 million. So, my response to this film was two-fold.
        I had seen the movie several times, but around 2013, I plopped down on a
        lazy afternoon and tuned in. What gave me that wave of emotion, was the scene where
        E.T. was languishing in the isolation chamber, and Elliott was watching the flower as the
        indicator of his health.
        When things went south, so did my tears.<br>
        The <b>next</b> time E.T. got the waterworks from me was in 2019. I was in the hospital with
        my just-born daughter. Everyone was sleeping, so I tuned in again. Only this time, it was an
        entirely different scene. Now it was the scene where E.T., Elliot, his older brother Michael
        and friends, were running from law enforcement in a high-speed chase to get E.T. back to the forest.
        This was even <em>before</em> the infamous bicycle-flight scene. I mean, this is when they were cutting across
        backyards,
        jumping dunes, swerving and evading their pursuers. The score (written by Jedi master John Williams),
        the cinemetography, the exhiliration, and their noble cause got to me. I thought to myself simply,
        "Man, they are really friends!" Risking their freedom, possibly even their lives, to help get E.T. home.
        I was instantly reminded of Jesus' own words to his followers in John 15:13, "Greater love has no one
        than this (love), that someone lay down his life for his friends." Obviously a <b>much</b> different context,
        as Jesus was speaking of his own death for the sins of the world,
        but this scene resonated with me in a profound way.
